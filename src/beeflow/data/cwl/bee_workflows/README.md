# BEE Workflows

This is a home for workflows which demonstrate BEE functionality.


Directories:  
* `clamr-wf`: CLAMR workflows with yaml files. The workflow executes CLAMR in a container, then processes png files getnerated by CLAMR into an MPEG video.

* `clamr-wf-noyaml/`: Original workflows with all parameters on the command line. The workflows execute CLAMR in a container, and then processes png files generated by CLAMR into an MPEG video.


* `simple-workflow/`: Contains some example workflows used for tests.
