# BEE Workflows

This is a home for workflows which demonstrate BEE functionality.

Files:  
* `cancel.cwl`: A workflow which sleeps for 20 seconds, long enough to demonstrate the cancel functionality BEE provides.

Directories:  
* `clamr-ffmpeg/`: A workflow which executes CLAMR in a container, and then processes png files generated by CLAMR into an MPEG video.
* `grep-wordcount/`: A workflow which parses an input file (`lorem.txt`) and counts the number of lines which contain the literal string "`integer`".
