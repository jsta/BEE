Todo: 

1. Set a config parameter for debug 
      only leave scripts in ~/.beeflow/worker when debug is set

2. Fix states, they need to be in an abstract class then specific for slurm

3. *** Priority: Use Charliecloud container when DockerRequirement is set, make
   also needs to be an abstract case or configuration
